# Just my dotfiles

## Warning!

This is my personal repo.  You're welcome to use it as an example or jumping off point, but please
do not rely on this being a stable repository for your own personal workflow.

# Install

`install.sh` is the install file, and will create symlinks to all of my configuration files, as well
as build some go scripts, and install some of the software required to make everything work.

# Homebrew

`brew.sh` will attempt a local (user-specific) install of Homebrew in `~/.brew` and install brews
and casks from the `brewfiles/` directory.  One for the core utilities and one for each platform
I install on.
